# fundmycause

This application is created as a learning tool to gain a deeper understanding of the Sinatra framework while utilizing the MVC architecture, as well as creating RESTful routes using CRUD actions.

That's a mouthful of words.

To break it down - this application creates and associates Users, Causes, and Categories so that users can create multiple causes in different categories. These causes can be viewed within their respective categories.
